# Assignment 4 - Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is part of the machine learning coursework and focuses on advanced techniques for anomaly detection, principal component analysis (PCA), and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The project explores various methods to identify outliers, reduce dimensions for logistic regression models, and fit data to Gaussian mixture models using the EM algorithm.

## Repository Structure

- `Assignment4_ML.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all the experiments and analyses.
- `Q1_dataset.csv`: file containing first datasets used in the experiments.
- - `Q2_dataset.csv`: file containing second datasets used in the experiments.
